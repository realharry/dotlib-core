# dotcore
C# core library for .Net Core.

This library contains "core" classes and interfaces, primarily, for UWP apps (C#).
It was originally created as part of the shared libraries for the UWP apps I was building for Windows 10,
and I am now in the process of open-sourcing some of them
in the hope that they might be useful for other UWP app developers.

Nuget package available on [Nuget Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotCore.Core/):

    Install-Package DotCore.Core


_Note: This is for C# only, and it is not a cross-language Universal Windows Component library._
